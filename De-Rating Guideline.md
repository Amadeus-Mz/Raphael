# Introduction
The term derating refers to the intentional reduction of electrical, thermal
and mechanical stresses on components to levels below their specified rating.
Derating is a means of extending component life, increasing reliability and
enhancing the end-of-life performance of equipment.  

Derating participates in the protection of components from unexpected
application anomalies and board design variations.  

The load ratios or limits given in clause 6 were derived from information
available at the time of writing this Standard and do not preclude further
derating for specific applications.  

This Standard also defines how to handle transients.
